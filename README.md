# A Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring System using Machine Learning

## 🔬 Project Overview
This project implements deep learning models to estimate resonant frequency and transmission magnitude (S21) from a FC-CSRR sensor for noninvasive blood glucose monitoring.

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Single-Step Model (S-FM)
- Double-Step Model (D-F and D-M)
- DNNs with Batch Normalization, Dropout, and ResNet

## 📁 Dataset
- `C1024.xlsx`: Experimental Network Analyzer measurements with 1024 sensor configurations.

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
# Create environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run notebooks
jupyter notebook notebooks/

# Launch Streamlit App
